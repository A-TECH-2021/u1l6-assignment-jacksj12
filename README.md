#U1L6 Movie Ratings
Movies always come with ratings. A bad movie may have 1.4 stars, and a great movie may have 4.9 stars.

## MovieRatings.java
### Statement
Your job is to write a program that asks the user for a movie rating as a double, and then rounds to the nearest int using the rounding with casting technique.

###Example 1:

```
Enter movie rating (as a decimal)
1.4
Rating rounded: 1
```
###Example 2:

```
Enter movie rating (as a decimal)
3.7
Rating rounded: 4
```
If the initialized value has a decimal place of .5 or greater, you should round up:
###Example 3:

```
Enter movie rating (as a decimal)
3.5
Rating rounded: 4
```

To see how you can use casting to round double values to the nearest int value, refer to the CSAwesome example Rounding using Casting.
